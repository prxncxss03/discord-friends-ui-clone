This is a Discord friends tab UI clone. There's no so much functionalities. Although It's really simple, I have  spent countless days doing this project after 2 days of learning the basics of react and 13 mins of learning tailwind LOL XD. I have no plans to refactor my code or add additional features to it. 

 ## :closed_book: History 
Originally, I wasn't planning to do this kind of stuff. My plan was to just have an overview of Tailwind so I've tried this almost [13 mins tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfaSUYaSgRo) by Fireship. In the end, I enjoyed it so the sidebar was done. However, it was incomplete so I decided to stand on my own feet and do something ~~by myself~~ :x: with the help of  **google** :heavy_check_mark:
and I picked the Friends tab because I thought it was much easier to make compared to the rest of the tabs.  

***Me: Who was bad at decision  making***

Honestly, Tailwind is easy to learn but writing this project in React was so difficult for me :alien::bomb:.
